April 27th, 2025 jkoppel: I ran the language tests for the first time in a long time to test the upgrade to GHC 9.8.4. I found that quite a few tests were failing that weren't failing in the paper. Whether this is due to changes in the environment that weren't stabilized, or to changes in Cubix, is as yet unknown. It was enough to determine however that the recent upgrades did not introduce any new test failers.

C: (run with Clang; didn’t get gcc re-set-up. Expected low success, because this is gcc-torture, not clang-torture)

^^ This implies one new failing case for tescov

^^ Suggests there’s one test that’s failing TAC that wasn’t before

Hoist: 70366/70382

Python:
  ID: 366
  Testcov: 364
  TAC: 219. From an error where “del t42” gets generated twice, second one errors. Since the version of Python is pinned, this may be new.
