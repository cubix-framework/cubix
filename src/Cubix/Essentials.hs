{- $fragments
  The first concept is that of a language fragment and signature. Language fragments in Cubix look like this:

  @
  data ExpL
  data StatementL

  data Statement e l where
    Assign :: String -> e ExpL             -> Statement e StatementL
    Seq    :: e StatementL -> e StatementL -> Statement e StatementL
  @

  This definition of @Statement@ is called a *language fragment*. It defines
  the nodes @Assign@ and @Seq@ without any reference to the larger language
  they are embedded in. The *labels* @StatementL@ and @ExpL@ are *sorts*, categories of terms.
  Popular languages commonly have a sort for top-level definitions, a sort for lvalues, a sort for
  import statements, etc. Specifying the sort separately from the language fragment makes it possible
  to modularly add new statements and expressions to a language definition, which we will demonstrate shortly.

  Expect to see the kind @(* -> *) -> * -> *@ a lot, the kind of language fragments.

  When you define a normal datatype (kind @*@) in Haskell, you might suffix it with
  @deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)@. The equivalent for these higher-kinded language fragments is
  to derive their higher-kinded equivalents using the `deriveAll` Template Haskell function, e.g.:

  @
  deriveAll [''Statement]
  @
-}


{- $sums
 Language fragments let one define nodes independent of a larger language. We shall soon
 show how to combine them into a **signature**. But first, let us define two more
 language fragments, @Conditional@ and @Exp@.

 @
 data Conditional e l where
    If :: e ExpL -> e StatementL -> e StatementL -> Conditional e StatementL

 data Exp e l where
    VarExp :: String           -> Exp e ExpL
    Add    :: e ExpL -> e ExpL -> Exp e ExpL
    -- other cases omitted
 @

 As a preview, note how @Conditional@ defines a new node @If@ of sort @Statement@. When these fragments are
 combined into a language, the @If@ node will be able to be included under a @Seq@ node, just as easily
 as if was defined in the @Statement@ fragment.

 A *signature* is a collection of language fragments. They take the form of a type-level list.
 Here is a signature for a language containing all the nodes in the @Statement@, @Conditional@, and @Exp@
 fragments.

 @
 type LangSig = '[Statement, Conditional, Exp]
 @

 Signatures have the kind @[(* -> *) -> * -> *]@, another kind you'll encounter frequently.
 Signatures are used by passing them to the `Sum` constructor, e.g.:

 @
 Sum LangSig
 @

 @Sum LangSig@ has kind @(* -> *) -> * -> *@, the same kind as language fragments. It is
 conceptually a single language fragment consisting of the combined nodes of @Statement@, @Conditional@,
 and @Exp@. It could even be placed in another language signature, and nested within another `Sum`,
 although this use case is not supported.

 The `Sum` constructor is important to Cubix, but you may not use it directly.
 More often, you'll use something like @Term LangSig@ --- but note that `Term` is defined using
 `Sum`.


 Signatures also appear with the `(:-<:)` "signature membership" constraint
 For the @LangSig@ definition above, the constraints @(Statement :-<: LangSig),
 @(Conditional :-<: LangSig)@, and @(Exp :-<: LangSig)@ all hold. In some type signatures,
 you'll also see the sibling constraint `(:<:)`: If @f :-<: fs@, then @f :<: (Sum fs)@. This
 makes it possible to write functions that run on any language that have a certain kind of node.
 E.g.: @(Statement :-<: fs) => Term fs l -> Term fs l@ is a rewrite on terms of any
 language that has the @@Statement@ language fragment.
-}

{- $terms

 Signatures define nodes of a language, but are agnostic to what the children
 of those nodes can be. Terms are what "tye the recursive knot" and turn
 a signature into the final type for a language. They do this by taking a signature,
 and specifying what the children of each node may be: other nodes from the same signature.

 In the slides for the accompanying tutorial, we give a decent pictoral explanation
 of this topic. Here's a textual version:

 It is easier to first present the type-level fixpoint for single-sorted terms.
 This is the classic example

 @
 data ListF e a = ConsF a e | NilF
 data Fix f = Fix (f (Fix f))
 type List = Fix ListF
 @

 The @ListF@ type was constructed by taking the normal recursive list type,
 and replacing the sublist in @Cons@ with a type parameter, @e@. This
 is called "unfixing" the type. Taking @Fix ListF@ undoes this;
 the result is isomorphic to the built-in list type (@[]@).

 Since Cubix terms have different sorts, Cubix uses a generalization
 of the @Fix@ constructor. Cubix's definition is equivalent to the following:

 @
 data Term fs l = Term (Sum fs (Term fs) l)
 @

 This recursively defines @Term fs@ to be
 terms of signature @fs@. It can be thought of as a product
 of the types for terms of each sort, so that, for each sort @l@,
 @Term fs l@ is the type of terms of signature @fs@ of sort @l@.
 For example, since @MJavaSig@ is Cubix's signature for Java,
 @Term MJavaSig@ denotes all terms in @Java@, and @Term MJavaSig StmtL@
 denotes Java statements.

 Breaking down the definition: @Sum fs e l@ denotes nodes drawn from
 any of the language fragments in signature @fs@, where the children of those
 nodes are given by @e@, and the top node has sort @l@. Here, @e@ is set to @Term fs@,
 meaning the children are other terms of this signature. These children have their
 own sorts. @l@ is then the sort of the root node.

 @cubix-compdata@ has a generalization of `Term` for terms-with-holes, called contexts.
 That is outside the scope of this document (see the original "Compositional Data Types"
 paper), but, know that, if you see the type @Cxt h f a l@, it specializes to @Term fs l@.
-}


{- $smart_constructors

  Consider the following language definition:

  @
  data ExpL
  data StatementL

  data Statement e l where
    Assign :: String -> e ExpL             -> Statement e StatementL
    Seq    :: e StatementL -> e StatementL -> Statement e StatementL

  data Exp e l where
     VarExp :: String           -> Exp e ExpL
     Add    :: e ExpL -> e ExpL -> Exp e ExpL

  deriveAll [''Statement, ''Exp]

  type LangSig = '[Statement, Exp]
  type Lang = Term LangSig
  @

  Using the raw constructors, here is how one would construct the tem
  @y = x+x@ . (n.b.: `inj` creates values of a `Sum` type.)

  @
  Term $ inj $ Assign "y" $ Term (inj (Add (Term (inj (VarExp "x"))) (Term (inj (VarExp "x")))))
  @

  This is obviously quite cumbersome. Towards that end, `deriveAll` creates /smart constructors/.
  Smart constructors look like this:

  @
  iAssign :: (Statement :-<: fs) => String -> Term fs ExpL -> Term fs StatementL
  @

  (Simplified here. The tutorial explains their real types.)

  With smart constructors, that term would be constructed like this:

  @
  iAssign "y" (iAdd (iVarExp "x) (iVarExp "x"))
  @
