Synopsis:            Strategy combinators for compositional data types
Description:         

    A library for strategic programming on compositional data types. See
    /The Essence of Strategic Programming/, <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.104.5296&rep=rep1&type=pdf>,
    by Ralf Laemmel et al.
    .
    Strategic programming is a way of allowing traversals to be written in a highly
    generic and composable fashion.
    .
    The names and general interface are modeled on the KURE library,
    but this library tries to be as composable as the lens library.
    .
    The type of a
    strategy combinator is the same as the /Vertical/ type
    that ekmett proposed and rejected as an extension to the current
    lens library. A /Vertical/ is essentially a monadic traversal. This hence
    could potentially be merged with the lens library.
